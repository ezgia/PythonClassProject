# World Bank Financial Development Indicators

World Bank Financial Indicators is a Flask web application that retrieves financial health indicator, GDP per capita (USD), for countries based on World Bank database, utilizing the wbdata library of Python.

## Installation

The following Python packages must be installed to use this project:
1. wbdata: use "pip install wbdata"
2. flask: use "pip install Flask"

## Usage

Edit main.py and coutnrypage.html to replace API keys with your own Mapbox user API key.

Run main.py in your terminal.

Enter resulting local host address generated by Flask into your web browser. 

Follow directions on the homepage; enter country codes to either the Search bar on the navigation panel, or the host route (e.g. for United States of America: /USA.html, /USA.json, or /USA.csv) to access information about a country. If you enter the wrong country code, an error page will appear instead.
